# Inspection System

## Deployment

**Platform:** Render.com
**Auto-deploy:** From GitHub `main` branch

### Services

| Service | URL/Host | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| inspection-api-o3hz | https://inspection-api-o3hz.onrender.com | Backend API (Flask) |
| inspection-web | https://inspection-web.onrender.com | Frontend Web (React) |
| dpg-d5uepavgi27c7395il90-a | PostgreSQL hostname | Database |

### Running Migrations
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Select the API service
3. Open Shell tab
4. Run: `flask db upgrade`

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend Web:** React, TypeScript, Ant Design
- **Frontend Mobile:** React Native, Expo
- **State:** React Query

## Key Rules
- NEVER commit or push to git without explicit user permission
- Always test locally first
- Support both Arabic (RTL) and English
- Use auto-fix loop: find → fix → verify → repeat
- Always explain what you're changing before doing it

## Current Issues / History
- Arabic analysis was returning English only — FIXED (bilingual prompts on all providers)
- WebSocket (flask-socketio) not installed — non-critical
- UI needs modernization and improvements

## What's Working
- Photo upload working
- Photo analysis working (English only)
- Database connected and healthy
- Deployed on Render (auto-deploy from main branch)
- AI fallback chains: 8 providers for photo, 6 for voice
- SambaNova + OpenRouter API keys configured on Render
- Together AI API key ready to add on Render

## What Needs Work
- ~~Arabic language support for AI analysis~~ ✅ Fixed
- Full QA testing needed (137 passing, 0 skipped, 15 remote-only deselected)
- Add TOGETHER_API_KEY on Render (key ready)
- Add GROQ_API_KEY on Render (biggest gap — free, 14,400 RPD audio)
- Google Gemini 429 quota: free tier limited to 5 RPM (known issue since Dec 2025)
- ~~New EAS build needed~~ ✅ Done — Build 934e89de (Android APK, preview profile)

## How to Run Locally
- Backend: `cd backend && flask run --debug`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- Local URL: http://localhost:5000 (API) / http://localhost:3000 (Web)

## Context for AI
- This is a bilingual inspection system for the Middle Eastern market
- Primary markets: Iraq, Lebanon, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan
- Part of Tellham Group business
- Owner: Ali

<!-- Claude: After EVERY change you make, add an entry here. NEVER skip this. -->

| Date | What Changed | Status |
| 2026-03-01 | Work Planning responsive layout: (1) minWidth:1024 + overflowX:auto wrapper stops all crushing; (2) collapsible right panel toggle (RightOutlined/LeftOutlined button, rightPanelVisible state); (3) CSS @media queries — ViewToggle icons-only at 1440px, Auto-Schedule label + contextual text hidden at 1280px; (4) toolbar right section flexShrink:1 + minWidth:0 + overflow:hidden; (5) collapsed day header overflow:hidden clips vertical text | ✅ Done |
| 2026-03-01 | Materials: Added "Download Import Template" button to MaterialsPage import modal — uses existing materialsApi.getTemplateUrl() (no backend change needed) | ✅ Done |
| 2026-03-01 | Work Planning: Replaced read-only materials card in job details modal with full CRUD UI — material selector + quantity + Add button; kit selector dropdown (auto-expands); stock indicator (✅/⚠️/❌ vs needed qty); Remove button with Popconfirm; only editable in draft status. Reuses existing workPlansApi.addMaterial/removeMaterial | ✅ Done |
\n| 2026-02-28 | Fix "Delete All Unassigned" on Inspection Assignments page: replaced N+1 loop (N×3 queries) with 6 batch queries; added DB index on `inspection_assignments.status`; changed frontend `invalidateQueries` → `refetchQueries` for reliable immediate reload | ✅ Done |
| 2026-02-28 | Work Planning drag-to-pool: expunge job from ORM session + pure raw SQL DELETE for job_checklist_responses/work_plan_assignments/work_plan_materials/work_plan_jobs — bypasses all lazy-loading; migrations added for lag_minutes (job_dependencies) + all missing columns in job_checklist_responses (IF NOT EXISTS) | ✅ Done |

| 2026-02-28 | Work Planning: employee-to-job assignment fixed — SimpleJobRow now has useDroppable (id: droppable-job-{id}) merged with useDraggable ref; customCollision prioritizes droppable-job-* hits over day columns so dropping an employee on a job card fires Case 3 and opens the Lead/Member modal | ✅ Done |
| 2026-02-28 | Work Planning: (1) assignment indicator on job cards — avatar chips (initials, gold=lead/blue=member, +N overflow, tooltip with full name) appear on SimpleJobRow when users are assigned; (2) workload badge on DraggableTeamMember — green/orange/red count badge with per-day tooltip (userAssignmentMap useMemo); (3) at-risk drawer is now a drop zone — drag any scheduled job onto it to unschedule; customCollision priority: pool → at-risk → job-droppable → day | ✅ Done |
| 2026-02-28 | Work Planning: drag-target highlight for employee→job assignment — wired isEmployeeOver (already computed in useDroppable) into SimpleJobRow background+border (purple tint #f9f0ff / #722ed1) + "↓ Assign here" label appears while hovering; disappears on pointer-leave | ✅ Done |
| 2026-02-27 | Offline photo & voice upload fix: photos copied to permanent storage + queued in new QueuedInspectionMedia queue; voice recordings saved locally so never lost; auto-upload on reconnect; amber badges/text instead of error alerts | ✅ Done |
